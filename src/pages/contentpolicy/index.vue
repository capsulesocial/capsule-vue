						Why We Built Blogchain
					</h2>
					<p class="message-content text-gray5 dark:text-gray3 py-2 text-sm text-justify">
						We built Blogchain because we believe that freedom of thought and broad intellectual discourse should be the
						norm, not the exception. We think that the best response to a disagreeable political opinion is more
						discourse, that the best answer to a problematic scientific result is more science, and so on.
					</p>
					<p class="message-content text-gray5 dark:text-gray3 py-2 text-sm text-justify">
						However, building a platform for free expression does not mean we are championing literally all speech.
						There are a few types of speech that simply aren’t appropriate on our platform. Such speech is defined below
						and will be moderated off the platform.
					</p>
					<p class="message-content text-gray5 dark:text-gray3 py-2 text-sm text-justify">
						<strong
							>Let’s talk in real, concrete examples regarding speech that we want to make more resilient, speech that
							we have seen censored on other platforms and that would remain on Blogchain.</strong
						>
						In 2021, both Facebook and Twitter instituted policies immediately banning and censoring any account that
						discussed the possibility that the COVID-19 pandemic may have originated from a failed laboratory
						experiment. We do not have a concrete position on this topic and don’t believe that our opinion on this lab
						leak theory should matter.
					</p>
					<p class="message-content text-gray5 dark:text-gray3 py-2 text-sm text-justify">
						Nevertheless, we did find it extremely troubling that all speech on this issue was completely restricted by
						major social media platforms, all the way up until the Biden administration issued a statement saying that
						the possibility of a “lab leak” was being investigated as legitimate. In the words of the Wall Street
						Journal’s editorial board:
					</p>
					<p class="message-content text-gray5 dark:text-gray3 py-2 text-sm text-justify">
						<em
							>Facebook acts in tandem with government on speech control. Question: When does “misinformation” stop
							being misinformation on social media? Answer: When Democratic government authorities give permission.</em
						>
					</p>
					<p class="message-content text-gray5 dark:text-gray3 py-2 text-sm text-justify">
						The issue here for us is the freedom to discuss pertinent intellectual topics without the implicit
						requirement of permission from government authorities. Unfortunately, the above example wasn’t the only one
						to occur in 2021.
					</p>
					<p class="message-content text-gray5 dark:text-gray3 py-2 text-sm text-justify">
						<strong>Let’s talk in real, concrete examples regarding speech that aren’t why we built Blogchain.</strong>
						Our commitment to free discourse and freedom of expression does cover intellectual expression in the
						broadest sense. But we simply won’t dedicate our time or the time of our team to uphold speech that doesn’t
						carry value: threats, harassment, intimidation, extortion, and violence are not why we’re here.
					</p>
					<p class="message-content text-gray5 dark:text-gray3 py-2 text-sm text-justify">
						To be blunt: we’re not building the next 4chan. We have nothing against 4chan and respect what it
						contributes to the Internet (for better or for worse) — but it simply is not what we, ourselves, have set
						out to build.
					</p>
					<p class="message-content text-gray5 dark:text-gray3 py-2 text-sm text-justify">
						We are providing unmatched guarantees of content resilience, backed by our decentralized technology, that
						applies to all content posted, regardless if we delist it from our Blogchain platform.
					</p>
					<p class="message-content text-gray5 dark:text-gray3 py-2 text-sm text-justify">
						We are here for the eccentric scientist, even if they are mistaken, so that they can express themselves and
						be debated and perhaps corrected. We are here for the next Edward Snowden, even if their disclosures cause
						upheaval. We are not here for the next account that wants to incite violence against a certain group of
						people or post racy memes. It’s just not why we chose to spend our time building this technology and this
						platform.
					</p>
					<h2 class="text-lightPrimaryText dark:text-darkPrimaryText text-h2 font-semibold py-2">
						Content Resilience Guarantees
					</h2>
					<p class="message-content text-gray5 dark:text-gray3 py-2 text-sm text-justify">
						What we're building with Blogchain takes advantage of decentralization technology in order to allow you to
						retain more control over your content.
						<strong
							>Blogchain’s decentralized design guarantees that content will remain peered across decentralized IPFS
							nodes no matter what — including if we decide to delist it from Blogchain.</strong
						>
					</p>
					<p class="message-content text-gray5 dark:text-gray3 py-2 text-sm text-justify">
						<strong
							>Blogchain also guarantees that any moderation action that we take will need to be done via smart
							contract, providing an authenticated, transparent ledger of all account actions, thereby prohibiting
							platform abuses such as "shadow banning."</strong
						>
					</p>
					<p class="message-content text-gray5 dark:text-gray3 py-2 text-sm text-justify">
						In these ways, Blogchain safeguards writers and readers against platform abuses that could potentially
						originate from us, the creators of the platform. This unique feature of Blogchain is unmatched by
						traditional online publishing platforms and is one that provides stronger assurances to readers and writers
						against internal corruption, dishonesty, deplatforming, and censorship.
					</p>
					<p class="message-content text-gray5 dark:text-gray3 py-2 text-sm text-justify">
						We will soon be building tools that allow any Blogchain user to quickly explore and view all Blogchain
						moderation activity — all of which is necessarily performed via blockchain smart contract operations — for
						an unmatched level of transparency.
					</p>
					<h2 class="text-lightPrimaryText dark:text-darkPrimaryText text-h2 font-semibold py-2">
						Four Generations of Content Policy
					</h2>
					<p class="message-content text-gray5 dark:text-gray3 py-2 text-sm text-justify">
						This document refers to “Generation 1” of Blogchain’s content policy. Generation 1 policies are, relative to
						future generations, the most centralized approach we’ll be taking to moderation. The idea is to be
						conservative at first, and to expand it as we continue to test the platform, eliminate bugs, better
						understand what we’re building, and actually have time to implement more complex features.
					</p>
					<p class="message-content text-gray5 dark:text-gray3 py-2 text-sm text-justify">
						Here’s an essential overview:
					</p>
					<ul class="message-content text-gray5 dark:text-gray3 py-2 text-sm list-disc list-inside py-2 px-5">
						<li>
							<strong>Generation 1</strong> (this policy document) outlines a content policy that is enforced by Capsule
							Social and Blogchain admins themselves, in a relatively centralized fashion. This is counter-balanced by
							all moderation operations being publicly logged on a smart contract and with all content remaining
							available across IPFS nodes outside of Blogchain, even if the content is moderated and delisted on
							Blogchain itself.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Generations 2, 3 and 4</strong> will bring in progressively more decentralized elements into
							content moderation:
							<strong>juries, community editors that users can subscribe to, community-based moderation</strong>, and
							more. We will work towards these features as Blogchain matures, and as we become confident in our
							understanding of what works best for what is essentially a community-run democracy that we’d like to build
							on the platform.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<h2 class="text-lightPrimaryText dark:text-darkPrimaryText text-h2 font-semibold py-2">Delisting Content</h2>
					<p class="message-content text-gray5 dark:text-gray3 py-2 text-sm text-justify">
						Delisting content refers to an operation whereby a Blogchain user is locked out of the platform and some or
						all of their content is rendered non-discoverable through the Blogchain interface.
					</p>
					<p class="message-content text-gray5 dark:text-gray3 py-2 text-sm text-justify">
						Blogchain nodes operated by Capsule Social won’t mirror delisted content through their IPFS and OrbitDB
						subcomponents. However, the content will remain available if provided by independent IPFS nodes anywhere on
						the Internet (outside of Blogchain) and can even be accessed through Blogchain software if the IPFS CID of
						the content is entered directly into the platform (for example, through the URL in the web browser address
						bar).
					</p>
					<p class="message-content text-gray5 dark:text-gray3 py-2 text-sm text-justify">
						Content may only be delisted through a smart contract call, which must include the following information:
					</p>
					<ul class="list-disc list-inside message-content text-gray5 dark:text-gray3 py-2 text-sm py-2 px-5">
						<li>The username that is being locked.</li>
						<li>The IPFS CID of the post that led to the delisting.</li>
						<li>A timestamp.</li>
						<li>Classification code for delisting reason.</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="message-content text-gray5 dark:text-gray3 py-2 text-sm text-justify">
						The delisted CIDs will be available via an OrbitDB log which is also publicly verifiable.
					</p>
					<h2 class="text-lightPrimaryText dark:text-darkPrimaryText text-h2 font-semibold py-2">Delistable Content</h2>
					<p class="message-content text-gray5 dark:text-gray3 py-2 text-sm text-justify">
						“Delistable Content” refers to types of content that are against the Blogchain Content Policy. Delistable
						content categories are currently defined as follows:
					</p>
					<ul class="list-disc list-inside message-content text-gray5 dark:text-gray3 py-2 text-sm py-2 px-5">
						<li>
							Content that is deemed illegal under United States law or Delaware state law, where Capsule Social, Inc.
							is based. This includes terrorism, fraud, extortion, and many types of pornography or non-consensual
							intimate imagery (NCII).
						</li>
						<li>
							Specifically targeted, real threats of violence or incitement to violence, including wishing or hoping
							that someone experiences physical harm. Persistent, malicious, targeted harassment or incitement to
							harassment. Promoting or encouraging suicide.
						</li>
						<li>
							Pornography or sexually exploitative content. We do allow depictions of nudity for artistic, journalistic,
							or related purposes, as well as erotic literature. Users may be asked to self-identify non-porn adult
							content and may have their accounts locked if they do not identify content correctly.
						</li>
						<li>Extremely gruesome, violent content, or content glorifying violence.</li>
						<li>
							Non-consensually posting an individual’s confidential personal information such as, for example, home
							address, passport number, or social security number (”doxxing”).
						</li>
						<li>Any content that is the result of a software or platform error or vulnerability.</li>
						<li>Plagiarism or the impersonation of any individual, group, or organization.</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="message-content text-gray5 dark:text-gray3 py-2 text-sm text-justify">
						Spam is also considered delistable content. Spam may take many forms, including but not limited to:
						repeated, unwanted, and/or unsolicited actions, automated or manual, that negatively affect users, groups,
						and/or the Blogchain platform itself; Content that is designed to further unlawful acts (such as phishing)
						or mislead recipients as to the source of the material (such as spoofing); Commercially-motivated spam that
						typically aims to drive traffic from Blogchain over to another website, service or initiative through
						backlinking or other inauthentic methods; Inauthentic engagements that try to make channels or content
						appear more popular than they are; Coordinated activity that attempts to artificially influence opinion
						through the use of multiple accounts, fake accounts, and/or scripting or automation.
